<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully completed the initial phase of development as per the defined workflow, focusing on a frontend-first approach with mock data. The primary objective was to replicate the aparelzx.vercel.app website with 100% visual fidelity. The engineer meticulously analyzed the target website using  and , then proceeded to implement the React frontend in several bulk file writes, creating components like Header, Hero, ProductCard, and Footer, alongside updating CSS for a dark, gaming-themed aesthetic. Iterative refinement was performed based on visual checks from screenshots, addressing missing elements and responsiveness. The frontend is now a complete, functional replica using mocked data, and the engineer is awaiting user confirmation to proceed with backend development. This trajectory demonstrates adherence to the 5-step process and the frontend-only with mock data first strategy.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement was to create a website store identical to https://aparelzx.vercel.app/, aiming for 100% visual resemblance. The target application is a premium Roblox pets store for the Grow A Garden game.

The implemented frontend, using mock data, now features:
- **Exact Design Match**: A dark theme with a distinct gaming aesthetic.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring mobile-friendliness for navigation and overall layout.
- **Product Catalog**: A grid displaying 13 Roblox pets, including their stock status.
- **Pricing Display**: Products show prices formatted in Indonesian Rupiah.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes hover effects on product cards and smooth-scrolling navigation.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Direct contact links for customer inquiries.
- **Theme Toggle**: A dark/light mode switcher for user preference.
- **Performance**: Optimized with lazy loading (implied by the agent's statement) and basic error handling.
- **Mock Data**: All product details, stock levels, and contact information are currently mocked.

The application currently serves as a complete teaser with fully functional frontend interactions, ready for potential backend integration to manage real data.
